# Research Agent - LangFlow Workflow

A multi-agent research system built with LangFlow that transforms broad topics into comprehensive, well-structured research reports through collaborative AI agents with provided tools and systematic workflow management. 

## üéØ Overview

This LangFlow workflow creates a simple research ecosystem that:

- **Transforms Topics into Plans**: Converts broad research topics into actionable research plans with specific questions
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinates between Research Manager and Specialized Research Agents
- **Comprehensive Tool Integration**: Leverages Wikipedia, Tavily Search API, Yahoo Finance, and Wolfram Alpha
- **Structured Report Generation**: Produces professional research reports with proper citations and analysis
- **Quality Control**: Includes completion verification and iterative improvement processes
- **Scalable Research**: Handles topics from academic subjects to financial analysis and current events

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Three-Agent System Design

#### 1. Research Manager Agent
- **Role**: Strategic planning and coordination
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyzes research topics for scope and complexity
  - Creates 3-5 specific, focused research questions
  - Designs detailed report structures
  - Provides research guidance and methodology
  - Defines scope and limitations

#### 2. Specialized Research Agent
- **Role**: In-depth information gathering and analysis
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Conducts comprehensive research on assigned sections
  - Generates effective search queries across multiple tools
  - Synthesizes information from diverse sources
  - Creates detailed summaries with proper citations
  - Identifies information gaps for additional research

#### 3. Conditional Edge: Research Completion Check
- **Role**: Quality assurance and workflow control
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Validates completion of all research sections
  - Ensures comprehensive content in each section
  - Controls workflow progression with binary decisions
  - Maintains quality standards throughout the process

## üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Tools

### Research Tools Available
- **Wikipedia**: Online encyclopedia for background information and established concepts
- **Tavily Search API**: LLM-optimized search engine for efficient, persistent results
- **Yahoo Finance**: Financial data, stock prices, and company news for business research
- **Wolfram Alpha**: Computational engine for numerical data, statistics, and scientific calculations (note this was replaced with arXiv)

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Tavily Search**: Broad information gathering and recent developments
- **Wikipedia**: Definitions, background context, and foundational knowledge
- **Yahoo Finance**: Financial metrics, market data, and business intelligence
- **Wolfram Alpha**: Mathematical calculations, scientific data, and statistical analysis

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- LangFlow installed and running
- API keys for integrated services:
  - OpenAI API (for language model capabilities)
  - Tavily Search API

### Installation

1. **Import the Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # In LangFlow interface
   File > Import > Select deep-research-system.json
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Set OpenAI API key for all agent components
   - Configure Tavily Search API credentials

3. **Test Tool Connections**:
   - Verify each tool responds correctly
   - Test API rate limits and quotas
   - Confirm data access permissions

## üìã Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Research Planning (Research Manager Agent)
```
Input: Broad research topic
‚Üì
1. Topic Analysis & Scope Definition
2. Initial Information Gathering (Tavily + Yahoo Finance)
3. Research Question Generation (3-5 specific questions)
4. Report Structure Design
5. Research Method Recommendations
‚Üì
Output: Comprehensive Research Plan
```

### Phase 2: Specialized Research (Research Agent)
```
Input: Research Plan + Assigned Section
‚Üì
1. Query Generation (3-5 targeted searches per section)
2. Multi-Tool Information Gathering
3. Cross-Reference & Credibility Assessment
4. Information Synthesis & Organization
5. Source Documentation & Citation
‚Üì
Output: Detailed Research Findings
```

### Phase 3: Completion Verification (Conditional Edge)
```
Input: Current Research Report State
‚Üì
1. Section Completion Check
2. Content Quality Validation
3. Binary Decision (Yes/No)
‚Üì
Output: Continue Research OR Finalize Report
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Rate Limits Exceeded**:
- Implement request throttling between tool calls
- Use caching for repeated queries
- Prioritize most important searches first

**Incomplete Research Sections**:
- Check Conditional Edge logic for completion criteria
- Verify search queries are generating relevant results
- Adjust research scope or question specificity

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Enhanced Tool Integration
- **Academic Databases**: PubMed, arXiv, Google Scholar integration
- **News APIs**: Real-time news monitoring and analysis
- **Social Media**: Sentiment analysis and trend tracking
- **Government Data**: Census, regulatory, and policy databases
- **Agent Specializations**: Create domain-specific research agents
- **Output Formats**: Develop templates for different report types
- **Quality Metrics**: Implement research quality scoring systems

## üìö Use Cases

### Academic Research
- Literature reviews and systematic studies
- Research proposal development
- Grant application support
